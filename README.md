# 🍽️ Restaurant Recommendation System🍴

Welcome to the **Restaurant Recommendation System** project! This web app lets you find the best restaurants based on your preferences. Whether you're looking for the best cuisines, a specific city, or a certain price range, our app has you covered. It's built using Flask, a trained machine learning model, and some tasty front-end design! 🌟

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Input Your Preferences: Enter details about your preferred restaurant (like city, cuisines, and price range) on the homepage.
2. Get Recommendations: Hit the Recommend button.
3. Explore the Results: Our model will analyze your inputs and provide you with a list of top restaurant recommendations. 🍽️

## 🧑‍🍳 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-recommendation-system.git
cd restaurant-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install the requirements:
```bash

### 3. Ensure your data file is in place
